# Avion Airlines

A few years ago, I made an airline as part of a group project for school. This is a cleaned up version of that website written up all by myself. This website uses vanilla javascript and jQuery, but is still functional without javascript enabled in the browser.

I've also made a similar project that uses 100% React. You can check that repo out here.


## Design

The main design concept for this app came from a dribble post I found on pinterest. These two pages guided my development of the rest of the app. You can view my prototype on figma or here from Adobe XD.

## Features
